<img src="https://ye-jiang.github.io/images/my_head.JPG" width="135" height="200" align="right">
I am a Ph.D student supervised by [Dr.Diana Maynard](http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/D.Maynard/) at the [GATE NLP group ](https://gate.ac.uk/) Department of Computer Science [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/). I am also a [Grantham Scholar](http://grantham.sheffield.ac.uk/scholars/jiang/) at the [Grantham Centre for Sustainable Futures](http://grantham.sheffield.ac.uk/).

My research interests lie in many NLP research topics, including machine learning approaches for text classification, topic modelling and representation learning.

## Projects
- [EUvsVirus: Team WeVerify Detecting Covid-19 Online Disinformation](https://github.com/yjiang18/CoronalVirus_Disinformation)
This is the code of several models, includes RNN with attention, CNN with BatchNorm, and HAN (Hierarchical Attention Network) for detecting Covid-19 disinformation on the EUvsVirus, this is a multiclass (11 categories) classification, and used BERT to generate word level embedding.
- [Topic-Aware Hierarchical Document Representation for News Biased Detection](https://github.com/yjiang18/Topical-Aware-Hierarchical-Document-Representation-for-Detecting-Bias-in-News-Articles)
A Keras implementation of the Hierarchical Attention Network (Yang et al, 2016) incorporating with LDA topic distributions.
- [Semantic Evaluation 2019, Task 4: Hyperpartisan News Detection.](https://github.com/GateNLP/semeval2019-hyperpartisan-bertha-von-suttner) 
This is the code for the SemEval 2019 Task 4, Hyperpartisan News Detection submitted by team Bertha von Suttner. The model created with this was the winning entry, see the [public leaderboard](https://pan.webis.de/semeval19/semeval19-web/leaderboard.html).
